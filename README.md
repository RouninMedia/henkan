# Henkan

**Henkan** (meaning _conversion_ or _transformation_ in Japanese) converts a short piece of text from any one of ***4 formats***:

 1) Standard Template
 2) URL
 3) HTML Attribute Value
 4) Plain Text

to any of the other formats.

**Henkan** is a fundamental building block of the **Ashiva CMS** in that it allows _different (but translatable)_ versions of the same core string to be used in:

 1) Variable Names
 2) URL Paths
 3) HTML Attributes
 4) CSS Classes
 5) the plain text content of Headings, Menu Items etc.

The 5 functions of **Henkan** were originally written in **PHP** but have proven so useful, they have since been rewritten in **javascript** and may, in future, be rewritten in other languages, libraries or frameworks, including (but not limited to):

 - jQuery
 - React.js
 - AngularJS
 - CoffeeScript
 - Node.js
